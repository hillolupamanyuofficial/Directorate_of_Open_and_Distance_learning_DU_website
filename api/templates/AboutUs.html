	<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
	<h6>
	  The Directorate of Open and Distance Learning(DODL), Dibrugarh
	  University was established in 2001 with a vision to reach the unreached.
	  During the last three decades, it was observed that most of the
	  Department and the Centres of studies of the University received a large
	  number of applications for admission into different programmes offered.
	  Due to limited number of seats in post-graduate and under-graduate
	  classes, a large number of students fail to enroll themselves as
	  students of the University. Considering the necessity of enabling the
	  youths who are either employed or self-employed and who are unable to
	  prosecute higher education due to economic or other reasons, the
	  University has set the vision of taking Higher Education to the
	  doorsteps of the learners.
	</h6>
	<h6 class="my-4">The major Objectives of the Directorate are:</h6>
	<div class="text-left">
	  <h6>
		1. To provide access to quality higher education to the people of the
		region who are deprived of higher education due to various reasons.
